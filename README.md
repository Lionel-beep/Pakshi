The purpose of our project is to detect the species of bird by
feature extraction using convolutional neural network . Our
prediction is based on a dataset of 315 different bird species ,
based on features like Beak shape , eyes , colour etc. We have
even reduced the image size along with number of parameters
to prevent overfitting .Moreover we have automatically
generated a Wikipedia link based on the predicted bird type.
